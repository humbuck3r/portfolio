          <p className="description">
            I grew up between commodore 64 and video games, I have been a
            musician since I was 16 years old, I am passionate about learning
            and working as a team with my bands. I am currently 32 years old and
            I am looking to grow in the world of web development and its
            technologies, I love meeting people and learning from them.
          </p>
          <p className="description">
            My education is totally self-taught, I am always looking for
            solutions to problems and if I cannot solve them I consult a
            professional. In my free time, besides dedicating myself to music, I
            really like riding my bicycle and traveling.
